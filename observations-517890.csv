They go from tree to tree ravaging the berries and leaving fallen leaves and berries all over the ground. They seem to visit a different tree everyday and spend between 15-30 minutes chowing down.

This flock had approximately 40-60 members. There was a couple that kept a close eye on me while the other ones fed. At times they were a bit playful. One thing that stood out to me was how well they blend into the tree because there were a mix of fall and spring colored leaves.

As I was walking my dog this evening, two parrots suddenly flew up out of their palm tree squawking and flying in circles - I didn't think much of it initially as parrots are pretty noisy in general, until this Cooper's hawk flew quickly past.  He landed in a tall deodore pine tree a few houses up the street sending many other birds flying, squawking, and dive bombing.  Before I could locate exactly where he'd landed in the tree, he flew off and I barely managed to get this shot of him as he disappeared (not quite as sharp as I would have liked).  Such beautiful birds!
